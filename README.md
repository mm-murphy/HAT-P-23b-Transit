# HAT-P-23b-Transit

My group and I observed one transit of the hot Jupiter HAT-P-23b, which was first discovered nearly ten years ago. From the transit light-curve, we derived an estimate for the planet-star radius ratio. Our measurement agreed with other measurements of the ratio from literature.
