# HAT-P-23b-Transit

Here, we present an observation of one transit of the hot Jupiter HAT-P-23b, made Sep. 18, 2019. We give raw data, extracted flux data, and our analysis of the transit. 

This work was done as part of the Fall 2019 AST443 course at Stony Brook University. Observations were made with the 14-inch Meade telescope at Stony Brook University, operated by the school's Department of Physics and Astronomy.
